# Online Payments Fraud Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions in online payments using various classification algorithms. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, and the project explores different models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, based on features such as transaction type, amount, and account balances.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:
- [Online Payments Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset)

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and mapping categorical variables to numerical values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted an analysis to understand the distribution of transaction types and the occurrence of fraud.
- **Modeling:** Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines, to classify transactions.
- **Evaluation:** Compared the performance of the models using cross-validation and selected the best model based on accuracy.
